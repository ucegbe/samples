# Deploying a Conversational Data Analyst Assistant Solution with Strands Agents SDK

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **⚡ Enhanced Deployment Option**: This solution can also be deployed using **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore** - Agentic platform to build, deploy and operate agents securely at scale using any framework and model.
> 
> **🔥 [Deploy with Amazon AgentCore →](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples/tree/main/02-use-cases/video-games-sales-assistant)**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **🚀 Ready-to-Deploy Agent Web Application**: Use this reference solution to build other agent-powered web applications across different industries. Extend the agent capabilities by adding custom tools for specific industry workflows and adapt it to various business domains.

This solution provides a Generative AI application reference that allows users to interact with data through a natural language interface. The solution leverages **[Strands Agents SDK](https://strandsagents.com/)** to build an agent that connects to a PostgreSQL database, providing data analysis capabilities through a Web Application interface. The infrastructure is deployed using AWS CDK.

🤖 A Data Analyst Assistant offers an approach to data analysis that enables enterprises to interact with their structured data through natural language conversations rather than complex SQL queries. This kind of assistant provides an intuitive question-answering for data analysis conversations and can be improved by offering data visualizations to enhance the user experience.

✨ This solution enables users to:

- Ask questions about video game sales data in natural language
- Receive AI-generated responses based on SQL queries to a PostgreSQL database
- View query results in tabular format
- Explore data through automatically generated visualizations
- Get insights and analysis from the AI assistant

🚀 This reference solution can help you explore use cases like:

- Empower analysts with real-time business intelligence
- Provide quick answers to C-level executives for common business questions
- Unlock new revenue streams through data monetization (consumer behavior, audience segmentation)
- Optimize infrastructure through performance insights

## Solution Overview

The following architecture diagram illustrates a reference solution for a generative AI data analyst assistant that is built using Strands Agents SDK and powered by Amazon Bedrock. This assistant enables users to access structured data that is stored in a PostgreSQL database through a question-answering interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This sample application is meant for demo purposes and is not production ready. Please make sure to validate the code with your organizations security best practices.
> 
> Cost Alert: This solution will cost approximately $375 USD per month, mainly for Aurora Serverless, RDS Proxy, Application Load Balancer, Fargate container and VPC NAT Gateway, plus the usage of on-demand services like Amazon Bedrock. Please ensure you understand these costs before deployment.

The solution deploys the following AWS services through AWS CDK:

- **Application Load Balancer and Fargate Container for Strands Agent**: Powers the ***Data Analyst Assistant*** that answers questions by generating SQL queries using Claude 3.7 Sonnet
  - Contains all the logic for agent configuration and tools
  - Built-in tools include:
    - Custom tools:
        - execute_sql_query
        - get_tables_information
    - Strands tool:
        - current_time
- **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2**: Stores the video game sales data with Data API enabled for secure access
- **Amazon ECS on Fargate**: Hosts the Strands Agent service with container insights and auto-scaling capabilities
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Two tables for tracking users' conversations and raw query results
- **Amazon S3**: Bucket for importing data into Aurora using the aws_s3 extension
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Securely stores database credentials with automatic rotation support
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**: Stores configuration parameters for the application (database ARNs, table names, and runtime settings)
- **Amazon VPC**: Custom VPC with public and private subnets, NAT Gateway, and VPC endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB
- **Security Groups**: Network security configurations for database, Fargate service, and load balancer
- **Amazon Cognito**: Provides user authentication and authorization with User Pool and Identity Pool for secure access
- **React Web Application**: Delivers the user interface for the assistant with integrated authentication
    - The application invokes the agent built with Strands Agents SDK for interacting with the assistant
    - Includes user sign-up, sign-in, and JWT token-based authentication
    - For chart generation, the application directly invokes the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model

> [!NOTE]
> This solution includes **Amazon Cognito authentication** for secure user access. The backend validates JWT tokens from authenticated users, ensuring only authorized users can interact with the Data Analyst Assistant. The solution supports both development (authentication disabled) and production (authentication enabled) configurations.

> [!TIP]
> You can also change the data source to connect to your preferred database engine by adapting the Agent's instructions and tool implementations.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Enhance AI safety and compliance by implementing **[Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/)** for your AI applications with the seamless integration offered by **[Strands Agents SDK](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/safety-security/guardrails/)**.

The **user interaction workflow** operates as follows:

- The web application sends user business questions to the agent built with Strands Agents SDK
- The agent (powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet) processes natural language and determines when to execute database queries
- The agent's built-in tools execute SQL queries against the Aurora PostgreSQL database and formulate an answer to the question
- After the agent's response is received by the web application, the raw data query results are retrieved from the DynamoDB table to display both the answer and the corresponding records
- For chart generation, the application invokes a model (powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to analyze the agent's answer and raw data query results to generate the necessary data to render an appropriate chart visualization

### Strands Agent Architecture

| Feature | Description |
|----------|----------|
| Native Tools   | current_time - A built-in Strands tool that provides the current date and time information based on user's timezone. |
| Custom Tools | get_tables_information - A custom tool that retrieves metadata about the database tables, including their structure, columns, and relationships, to help the agent understand the database schema.<br>execute_sql_query - A custom tool that allows the agent to run SQL queries against the PostgreSQL database based on the user's natural language questions, retrieving the requested data for analysis. |
| Model Provider | Amazon Bedrock |

## Deployment Instructions

The deployment consists of two main steps:

1. **Generative AI Application - [Data Source and Strands Agent Deployment with CDK](./cdk-strands-data-analyst-assistant/)**
2. **Front-End Implementation - [Integrating Strands Agent with a Ready-to-Use Data Analyst Assistant Application](./amplify-video-games-sales-assistant-strands/)**

> [!NOTE]
> *It is recommended to use the Oregon (us-west-2) or N. Virginia (us-east-1) regions to deploy the application.*

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Remember to clean up resources after testing to avoid unnecessary costs by following the clean-up steps provided.
