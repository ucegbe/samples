    "# ReAct Agent Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this example we will guide you through how to create a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent implementation using Strands Agents default orchestration. We will demonstrate a single-agent system that combines reasoning with direct tool execution, providing a baseline for comparison with multi-agent orchestration patterns. This notebook also serves as an introduction to TauBench tools and dataset for airline customer service scenarios.\n",
