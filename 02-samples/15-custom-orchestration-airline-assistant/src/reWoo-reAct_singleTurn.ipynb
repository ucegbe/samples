    "## Overview\n",
    "In this example we will guide you through how to create a REWOO-ReAct hybrid pattern implementation using Strands multiagent orchestration. We will demonstrate a two-agent system that combines REWOO's structured planning approach with ReAct's direct tool execution, creating an efficient hybrid workflow that balances planning reliability with execution flexibility for airline customer service tasks.\n",

    "## Key Features\n",
    "* **Two-agent hybrid pipeline**: Planner generates structured plans, Solver executes with ReAct flexibility\n",
    "* **Best of both worlds**: REWOO's planning reliability combined with ReAct's execution adaptability\n",
    "* **Reduced latency**: Only 2 agents vs 3 in pure REWOO implementation\n",
    "* **Structured execution**: Plans use #E1, #E2, #E3 format for guided tool execution\n",
    "* **ReAct flexibility**: Solver can adapt execution based on intermediate results and policy constraints\n",
    "* **Better error handling**: ReAct solver can recover from plan deviations and policy violations\n",
    "* **Plan-guided execution**: Maintains systematic approach while allowing execution flexibility\n",
    "* **Airline domain integration**: Complete integration with MAbench airline tools and TauBench datasets\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's implement the **custom agent classes** that extend the base Strands Agent to work with our multiagent graph. We create these custom classes so that each agent can properly integrate with the graph's streaming architecture while maintaining their specialized roles in the hybrid REWOO-ReAct pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PlannerAgent Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PlannerAgent` class serves as the entry point for our hybrid system, generating structured plans without executing any tools. We implement this with a custom `stream_async` method so that it can seamlessly integrate with the multiagent graph while providing the structured output format required for the ReAct solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent normalizes the input prompt and calls its `generate_flight_plan` tool to create the structured execution plan.

We structure it this way so that the graph can easily pass the plan to the next agent in the workflow.\n",

    "\n",
    "The agent uses the `extract_original_task_and_plan` helper function to separate the user's original request from the planner's structured output. It then calls the `solve_flight_query` tool with both components, allowing the ReAct agent to execute the plan while maintaining flexibility to adapt based on intermediate results and policy constraints.\n",

    "\n",
    "We create instances of both custom agents with their respective tools and configurations. The `planner_agent` uses only the `generate_flight_plan` tool to maintain separation of concerns, while the `solver_agent` uses the `solve_flight_query` tool that has access to all airline operations through its internal ReAct implementation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `create_rewoo_react_graph` function uses the Strands `GraphBuilder` to construct our two-agent hybrid system. We add both the `planner_agent` and `solver_agent` as nodes in the graph with their respective identifiers, allowing the graph to route messages and maintain execution flow between the planning and execution phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential Flow Design\n",
    "\n",
    "We establish the connection between agents using `add_edge(\"planner\", \"solver\")`, creating a direct sequential path from the planner's structured output to the solver's ReAct execution. We design it this way so that the hybrid approach maintains the systematic planning benefits of REWOO while enabling the execution flexibility of ReAct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entry Point and Execution\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Total execution time**: 25.78 seconds\n",
    "- **Nodes executed**: 2 (Planner → Solver)\n",
    "- **Tools used**: 5 (including `think` and `transfer_to_human_agents`)\n",
    "- **Status**: COMPLETED with proper human escalation\n",

    "## Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you're seeing in this response correlates to the ReWOO-ReAct hybrid notebook framework:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured Planning with Conversational Execution**: Combines ReWOO's systematic approach with ReAct's natural language flow\n",
    "- **Proactive Policy Analysis**: The `think` step demonstrates embedded reasoning within the structured plan\n",
    "- **Complete Service Coverage**: Addresses both flight change and baggage removal through appropriate channels\n",
    "- **Proper Escalation Logic**: Successfully transfers baggage removal to human agents as planned\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Information Gathering**: Includes user verification and complete reservation analysis\n",
    "- **Balanced Efficiency**: Achieves thorough coverage while maintaining reasonable execution time (25.78s)\n",
    "\n",
    "This hybrid approach demonstrates the best of both frameworks - ReWOO's systematic completeness with ReAct's user-friendly communication style.\n",

    "## Congrats!\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully created and tested a REWOO-ReAct hybrid pattern implementation using Strands multiagent orchestration. This system demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two-agent hybrid architecture** combining REWOO's structured planning with ReAct's execution flexibility for optimal performance\n",
    "- **Plan-guided execution workflow** where structured reasoning (#E1, #E2, #E3 format) guides ReAct tool execution while maintaining adaptability\n",
    "- **Strands GraphBuilder integration** using custom Agent classes with stream_async() methods for seamless multiagent coordination\n",
    "- **Best-of-both-worlds approach** leveraging REWOO's planning reliability and ReAct's execution flexibility with reduced latency\n",
    "- **Airline domain integration** with comprehensive MAbench tool execution and TauBench evaluation datasets for real-world testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The REWOO-ReAct hybrid pattern excels at complex multi-step tasks requiring both systematic planning and execution adaptability, such as airline customer service scenarios where structured planning ensures comprehensive coverage while ReAct flexibility handles policy constraints, error recovery, and dynamic decision-making during tool execution.\n",
