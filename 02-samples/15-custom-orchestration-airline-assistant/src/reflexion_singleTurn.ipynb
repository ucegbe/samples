    "### Revised Answer Generation Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The `generate_revised_answer` tool orchestrates the complete revision cycle by combining query improvement, response regeneration, and quality assessment. We implement this as a single tool so that all revision steps happen atomically and maintain consistency throughout the improvement process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool follows this workflow:\n",
    "1. **Query Improvement**: Uses the query improver agent to create a better version of the user query based on current reflection feedback\n",
    "2. **Response Regeneration**: Executes the improved query using the flight executor to generate a revised answer\n",
    "3. **Quality Assessment**: Applies the reflection system prompt to analyze the new response and determine if further revision is needed\n",
    "4. **Structured Output**: Returns all components in the standardized format for the next iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative Improvement Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The Revisor Agent creates a feedback loop where each iteration builds upon the insights from previous attempts. We do this so that the system can progressively address different quality issues rather than getting stuck on the same problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The revision decision is made by checking if \"REVISE\" appears in the reflection text, providing a simple but effective mechanism for the agent to signal when it believes the response quality is sufficient. This approach allows the system to naturally converge on high-quality responses while preventing infinite revision loops.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's create the **Reflexion multiagent graph** that orchestrates the interaction between our Draft and Revisor agents. This function builds the complete workflow using the Strands GraphBuilder to create a seamless reflection and revision pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Creation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_reflexion_graph` function instantiates both agent classes and connects them in a sequential workflow. We do this so that the draft agent's output automatically flows to the revisor agent for quality assessment and potential improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create instances of both `DraftAgent` and `RevisorAgent` classes, ensuring they're properly initialized with their respective tools and configurations. We instantiate them separately so that each agent maintains its own state and tool access throughout the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Builder Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Strands `GraphBuilder`, we add both agents as nodes in our multiagent graph. The `add_node` method registers each agent with a unique identifier (\"draft\" and \"revisor\") that allows the graph to route messages and maintain execution flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then establish the connection between agents using `add_edge(draft_node, revisor_node)`, creating a direct path from the draft agent's output to the revisor agent's input. We do this so that the reflection process happens automatically without requiring manual intervention or complex routing logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entry Point and Execution Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The `set_entry_point(\"draft\")` call designates the draft agent as the starting point for all user queries. We configure it this way so that every interaction begins with initial response generation, followed by the reflection and revision process.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the graph executes, it follows this flow:\n",
    "1. User query enters at the draft agent\n",
    "2. Draft agent generates initial response with self-reflection\n",
    "3. Output automatically routes to revisor agent\n",
    "4. Revisor agent performs iterative improvement until quality standards are met\n",
    "5. Final polished response is returned to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "The final line `reflexion_graph = create_reflexion_graph()` builds and stores the complete multiagent graph, making it ready for execution. We create this as a reusable object so that multiple queries can be processed through the same reflection pipeline without rebuilding the graph structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Performance Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "The test function captures execution timing using `time.time()` measurements around the graph execution. We measure this so that we can evaluate the performance impact of the reflection process compared to single-pass approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The timing measurement helps identify whether the quality improvements from reflection justify the additional computational cost, which is crucial for production deployment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Execution Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing the graph with the user query, the function extracts comprehensive execution metadata from the result object. We analyze these metrics so that we can understand how the multiagent graph performed and whether both agents completed successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key metrics include:\n",
    "- **Graph Status**: Overall execution success or failure\n",
    "- **Total Nodes**: Number of agents in the graph (should be 2 for our Reflexion pattern)\n",
    "- **Completed Nodes**: How many agents finished execution\n",
    "- **Execution Order**: The sequence in which agents were invoked\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node-Level Result Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "The function iterates through each node's results to display the individual agent outputs. We examine each node separately so that we can trace the evolution from initial draft response to final refined answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each agent (draft and revisor), the function shows the execution status and result content, allowing developers to see exactly how the reflection process improved the response quality.\n",

    "### Test Execution Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The final section demonstrates how to run a test using a specific question from the tasks dataset. We select `question_id = 43` and extract the corresponding user query to test the system with real airline customer service scenarios.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Draft Phase\n",
    "The **Draft Agent** creates an initial response:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Answer**: Found direct flight options (HAT266 at 1:00 PM, HAT175 at 5:00 PM) and stated baggage removal policy restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Reflection**: Critical analysis identifying major gaps:\n",
    "- Missing current booking analysis\n",
    "- Incomplete cost comparison \n",
    "- Limited actionability\n",
    "- Unverified baggage policy claims\n",

    "The **Revisor Agent** generates an improved response:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Booking Analysis**:\n",

    "\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Current Flights: LAS → PHX → IAH (one-stop) on May 19\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Total Cost: $1,134 (paid via gift card)\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Baggage: 1 checked bag (FREE for economy passengers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Passengers: 2 (James Taylor, Ivan Taylor)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Available Direct Options**:\n",
    "- HAT266: 1:00 PM departure, $146 per person\n",
    "- HAT175: 5:00 PM departure, $155 per person\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Limitations Acknowledged**:\n",
    "- Cannot access detailed change fee policies\n",
    "- Cannot calculate exact cost comparisons\n",
    "- Cannot verify complete baggage refund policies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Recommendation**: Transfer to human agent for comprehensive policy verification and financial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Reflection**: Accepts the revised response as appropriately handling system limitations while providing available information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Summary\n",
    "- **Total execution time**: 62.11 seconds\n",
    "- **Nodes executed**: 2 (Draft → Revisor)\n",
    "- **Status**: COMPLETED with human agent escalation\n",
    "- **Tools used**: `get_reservation_details`, `search_direct_flight`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you're seeing in this response correlates to the Reflexion notebook framework in several ways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Critical Analysis**: The framework demonstrates metacognitive abilities by critically evaluating its own initial response and identifying specific deficiencies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Improvement**: Shows the draft-revise cycle where the initial answer is systematically improved based on self-identified weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transparent Limitations**: Unlike other frameworks, Reflexion explicitly acknowledges what it cannot do rather than providing potentially incorrect information\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: The self-reflection process acts as an internal quality control mechanism, ensuring responses meet higher standards before delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Responsible AI Behavior**: Demonstrates appropriate escalation to human agents when system limitations prevent complete task fulfillment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured Self-Evaluation**: Uses systematic criteria (completeness, clarity, actionability) to assess response quality, showing sophisticated self-monitoring capabilities"
